# aims-learning-resources

This is a very simple repo with the aim to list down all possible resources for understanding **AIMS (Artificial Intelligence Management System)**

This repo is not updated as fast as the knowledge of AIMS gets updated. However, I will try to keep it as up-to-date as possible. Feel free to suggest additions or updates.
