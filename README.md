This repository contains resources that are useful when learning about **ISO 42001:2023**. There are three key sections to this repo

1. *Resources* - This is a file that lists all key resources. It is divided into two broad sections - Governance Resources and Technical Resources.
2. *Gen AI tools* - This is a file that lists down the popular GenAI tools avaialble. This is the file that tends to get outdated the fastest. Use this as a ready reckoner, but remember that new GenAI tools keep getting released everyday.
3. *Definitions* - This is an experimental page where I am exploring providing some basic definitions for AI based tools

**TL;DR**

Start with ISO 42001:2023. Then read the list of risks on either MIT AI risk repository or the DOE AI risks page.
