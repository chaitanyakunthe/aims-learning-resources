# Some Definitions

These are some definitions extracted from some of the documents shared in the Resources.md page.

### ML Applications as per *NCSC Guidelines for Secure AI development*

We define ML applications as applications that:
- involve software components (models) that allow computers to recognise and bring context to patterns in data without the rules having to be explicitly programmed by a human
- generate predictions, recommendations, or decisions based on statistical reasoning

### Adversarial Machine Learning as per *NCSC Guidelines for Secure AI development*
 - the exploitation of fundamental vulnerabilities in ML components, including hardware, software, workflows and supply chains.
AML enables attackers to cause unintended behaviours in ML systems which can include:
- affecting the modelâ€™s classification or regression performance
- allowing users to perform unauthorised actions
- extracting sensitive model information
